            <p>I received some <i>very bad news</i> today.</p>

<div><a class="piclink" href="/images/patrick_knowles.jpg"><img src="/images/patrick-knowles.jpg" alt="Patrick Knowles" width="200" height="185" /></a></div>I don't have many details, but I received a couple of messages today saying that Patrick Knowles passed away on February 3, 2005, and that a memorial service will be held in California at a soon to be determined date.

<p>I have heard that Patrick was very sick, and suffering from an old injury to his back. I'm afraid that I don't have any more information than that at the moment.</p>

<p>It's hard to know what to say...I'm pretty shocked to hear this. Just back in October I was hearing about the <a href="/zot/miscellanea/zot-reunion-in-the-works.html">possibilities of a Zot reunion</a>, and now this tragic news.</p>

<p>I know that Patrick will be sorely missed. Whenever I heard from anyone even remotely connected with the band they all asked about Patrick first. Although I never knew the man, I do know that his talent was considerable and that he certainly had a charisma that drew others to him. </p>

<p>Patrick, I'm just an old Zot fan living in Japan, but you and your music made a big impression on more people than you may ever know. The first mail message I ever got concerning the Zot page was from one of your co-workers who told me that you'd seen the page and you'd got a kick out of it. I'd always hoped that someday I'd have the opportunity to get in touch with you and ask you more about your music, but unfortunately that won't be possible now. You were too young to leave us Patrick. </p>

<p>Thank you for all the <a href="/zot/audio-files/">great music</a> and memories!</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.80sretromusic.com/">Ultimate 80's Retro Music Page</a> has a large collection of band bios from the 80's, including one for <a href="http://www.80sretromusic.com/biography/Z/zot.htm">Zot</a>. This was taken from the <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?opt1=1&P=amg&sql=Zot">All Music Guide listing for Zot</a> which doesn't seem to be complete anymore. I remember this from their old database. Fortunately the people at the Ultimate 80's Retro Music Page archived this blurb:</p>

<p><i>Veteran producer Pat Moran, who worked with Edie Brickell, Jon Butcher Axis, and so many others, engineers and produces this highly listenable and entertaining album by the band Zot. It's the songs and vocals of keyboard player Randy Wayne who would go on to work with one of the big acts at the Stiefel Company which represented Zot, that act being Rod Stewart. There's appropriate alien cover art and a vocal from Wayne which is borderline Nick Gilder veering off into David Bowie territory. Randy Wayne would have been the perfect addition to the Spiders From Mars when Bowie's rhythm section tried to launch a career of their own. This is the stuff fans of Ziggy Stardust could truly have appreciated. Though there are no sparks of brilliance à la Roxy Music or other adventurous experimental bands, Zot works because the music is simple, ethereal, and quite pleasing. </p>

<p>The undercurrents could be stronger, there is no push and pull, and while songs like "I Believe in Miracles" have their moments, they just don't have enough to get them all the way over the bar that was commercial FM radio. Ultravox would at least throw you a "Wide Boys," and something like that would've been a plus here. It's all original compositions by Randy Wayne, and had he covered a Ric Ocasek tune from the Cars' Panorama album or even Sweeny Todd's "Roxy Roller," or Ultravox, the album would have that diversion it seems to be crying out for. But the bright side is that the LP is very good and is a fun listen: something to pull out and play when the mood strikes. A surprisingly pleasant disc despite its lack of dynamics. ~ Joe Viglione, All Music Guide</i></p>
