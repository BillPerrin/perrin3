            <p>I heard from Andy Thomas recently and he pointed me over to <a href="http://www.airdiamond.com/">Dave Diamond's new website</a>. Dave's doing a lot with 3D graphics and flight instruction. Here's a snippet from his About page:</p>

<p><i>At age 10, Diamond had his heart set on becoming an airline pilot. "There was just nothing cooler to me than a pilot," recalls Diamond. But FAA regulations require that pilot applicants be 17 years or older. "I wanted to fly, but I knew it wasn't going to happen any time soon. So I focused on my second love: music. There was no FAA regulation preventing a 10-year old from becoming a rock star!"</p>

<p>Seven years later Diamond found himself a founding member of the 1980s rock group Berlin. During the band's first tour he experienced flight in a small airplane for the first time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/zot/davidinberlin.jpg" alt="Dave Diamond" /></p>

<p>"We were staying in a hotel in East Lansing, Michigan," recalls Diamond. "The hotel's bartender was also a flight instructor, which I found to be a curious combination of careers. He invited me to fly with him." Then 17, finally old enough to earn his wings, Diamond was without the time to complete the training. "Being a rock star can really eat into your day," jokes Diamond.</i></p>

I've been busy with my drumming, music and recently artwork.  In the 90's I was in a band called <strong>Modern Faith</strong> (an alternative band) and played in the O.C. and every spring break in San Felipe, Mexico and every year at grad nights at Disneyland with the band <strong><a href="http://www.nodoubt.com/">No Doubt</a></strong> (1995, 1996).  In early 2000 I played with <a href="http://www.crawfordmusic.net/">John Crawford</a> of <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_(band)">Berlin</a></strong> and did a CD.  For the following three years played with a punk rock band called <strong><a href="http://www.centrocore.com/">El Centro</a></strong>.  We toured the <strong><a href="http://www.warpedtour.com/">Warp Tour</a></strong> with such bands as <strong><a href="http://www.blink182.com/">Blink 182</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://sublimespot.com/">Sublime</a>, <a href="http://www.enjoyincubus.com/">Incabus</a>, <a href="http://badreligion.com/">Bad Religion</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.janesaddiction.com/">Jane's Addiction</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.greenday.com/">Green Day</a></strong>.

<p>Versatile is the word that best discribes bassist, Bryant Simpson.</p>

<div style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img src="/images/zot/bryant-beach-1.jpg" alt="Bryant Simpson" /></div>
<p>Born in Los Angeles, Bryant's musical career began in Fullerton, California, the birthplace of the Fender bass. He was always enamored with the sound of the bass, but it wasn't until high school that he got the opportunity to explore his musical desires, when his father bought Bryant a bass to keep him out of trouble. From that moment, he was hooked! He then moved on to Fullerton College and for the next 2 years played electric and acoustic bass in their award winning jazz ensemble under the direction of Terry Blackley and Jim Linnahon. After graduating, Bryant began studying privately with MIT staff bassist and jazz veteran, Luther Hughes and bass virtuoso, John Pattitucci, while maintaining steady work in the Orange County area Top 40 scene and as a member of the jazz quartet "Blueprint", featuring Ron Kobayashi. Although his roots were in funk, R&amp;B and jazz, Bryant also had a love for rock music and in 1982 he joined the local Orange County rock group ZOT. Adding his funky groove with their modern rock edge proved to be a winning combination and the group was soon signed to Elektra/Asylum records. They enjoyed brief success until the group disbanded in 1985.</p>

            <p>I received some <i>very bad news</i> today.</p>

<div><a class="piclink" href="/images/patrick_knowles.jpg"><img src="/images/patrick-knowles.jpg" alt="Patrick Knowles" width="200" height="185" /></a></div>I don't have many details, but I received a couple of messages today saying that Patrick Knowles passed away on February 3, 2005, and that a memorial service will be held in California at a soon to be determined date.

<p>I have heard that Patrick was very sick, and suffering from an old injury to his back. I'm afraid that I don't have any more information than that at the moment.</p>

<p>It's hard to know what to say...I'm pretty shocked to hear this. Just back in October I was hearing about the <a href="/zot/miscellanea/zot-reunion-in-the-works.html">possibilities of a Zot reunion</a>, and now this tragic news.</p>

<p>I know that Patrick will be sorely missed. Whenever I heard from anyone even remotely connected with the band they all asked about Patrick first. Although I never knew the man, I do know that his talent was considerable and that he certainly had a charisma that drew others to him. </p>

<p>Patrick, I'm just an old Zot fan living in Japan, but you and your music made a big impression on more people than you may ever know. The first mail message I ever got concerning the Zot page was from one of your co-workers who told me that you'd seen the page and you'd got a kick out of it. I'd always hoped that someday I'd have the opportunity to get in touch with you and ask you more about your music, but unfortunately that won't be possible now. You were too young to leave us Patrick. </p>

<p>Thank you for all the <a href="/zot/audio-files/">great music</a> and memories!</p>

            <p>I found an interview of <b>David Diamond</b> over on the <a href="http://www.berlinpage.com/index.html">Berlin website</a> in which he mentions his participation in <b>Zot</b>. The interview was conducted by a student in April 1994 for a music industry class.</p>

<p>Here are some excerpts:</p>

<p><i><b>MR:</b> How did you get involved with Berlin? Were they friends of yours?</i></p>

<p><i><b>DD:</b> No. I was playing in a local band that actually went on later to get a deal with Elektra called <b>Zot</b>. We went one night to a place in West Hollywood called Flippers, which is no longer there. It was one of those roller-disco's (laughs). Anyway, there was this band playing there called Null & Void, and they were really noisy and very experimental, while <b>Zot</b> was a very commercial pop band like Styx, SuperTramp, and those other tired bands that seemed to appeal to so many blonde beach types. I made some comment about how innovative Null & Void was. So, the singer for <b>Zot</b>, whom I never got along with anyway said "Why don't you join them?" Well just as he said that, I realized that I knew someone on Null & Void's crew and so I went over to say "hi" to him. He made some comment about the fact that they were about to fire their bass player. I said "Well, you know what, I'd like to audition." So, the very next week, I got a call from them and went to audition.</i></p>

            <p>In addition to keyboard work for Rod Stewart Randy also co-wrote the a single with Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams & Jim Vallance (I think it charted very well)</p>

<p>ANOTHER HEARTACHE<br />
(B. Adams, J. Vallance, R. Stewart, R. Wayne)</p>

<p>Also I think I remember Randy doing a keyboard session for Dave Mustaine and Megadeath after returning to L.A. From England.</p>

<p><br />
Randy, Pat, Chris and Bryant also worked on the score for the Emilio Estevez film "That Was Then, This Is Now" They did some underscore and songs. Randy co-wrote the title song with, I think, Holly Knight and sang it, again I think with Holly-not sure.</p>

            <p>What a discovery.  I am listening to the CD of ZOT featuring my (poorly credited) contributions on the PPG Waveterm and Wave 2.3 sampling/synthesis system. I enjoyed the company of ZOT members, playing around Orange County summer 1985.  I have some pics of the support slot for Culture Club at Costa Mesa's Pacific Amphitheatre. I now live back in Wales, UK.<br />
Cheers and please get in touch and send my best to <b>Patrick Knowles</b>.</p>
