<h2>Chris Stewart - Drums</h2>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<div style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><a href="../photos/zot-chris-stewart-001.jpg"><img src="../photos/zot-chris-stewart-thumb-001.jpg" alt="Chris Stewart" /></a></div>Hope everyone is doing great!  I've been busy with my drumming, music and recently artwork.  In the 90's I was in a band called <strong>Modern Faith</strong> (an alternative band) and played in the O.C. and every spring break in San Felipe, Mexico and every year at grad nights at Disneyland with the band <strong><a href="http://www.nodoubt.com/">No Doubt</a></strong> (1995, 1996).  In early 2000 I played with <a href="http://www.crawfordmusic.net/">John Crawford</a> of <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_(band)">Berlin</a></strong> and did a CD.  For the following three years played with a punk rock band called <strong><a href="http://www.centrocore.com/">El Centro</a></strong>.  We toured the <strong><a href="http://www.warpedtour.com/">Warp Tour</a></strong> with such bands as <strong><a href="http://www.blink182.com/">Blink 182</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://sublimespot.com/">Sublime</a>, <a href="http://www.enjoyincubus.com/">Incabus</a>, <a href="http://badreligion.com/">Bad Religion</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.janesaddiction.com/">Jane's Addiction</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.greenday.com/">Green Day</a></strong>.  (Blink also put my name of their <em>Enima</em> CD)

<div style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><a href="../photos/zot-chris-stewart-003.jpg"><img src="../photos/zot-chris-stewart-thumb-003.jpg" alt="Chris Stewart" /></a></div>In 2003 my manager was killed and my singer was seriously injured in the terrorist bombing in Bali that killed over 230 people.  I was supposed to go but decided not to.   To this day, I don't know why I didn't go but the Holy Spirit was watching over me.  My singer was all over tv and the newspapers describing the carnage that ensued.  It was a very difficult time.  The band broke up because of this.  

<p>Today I am teaching drums and doing studio work with different artists.  Currently, I am in pre-production for a drumming instruction CD--called <strong>Touch</strong>--so watch out for it!  There will be music too!</p>

<p>Also, I thought all of you should know, in the near future I am re-releasing the ZOT album to a CD with the old classic ZOT look but with a few new things.  It will be dedicated to <a href="patrick-knowles-rip.html">Patrick Knowles</a>, my friend forever and I still love and miss him very much.  He was and still is my favorite guitarist.  </p>

<div style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><a href="../photos/zot-chris-stewart-002.jpg"><img src="../photos/zot-chris-stewart-thumb-002.jpg" alt="Chris Stewart" /></a></div>Hey Bryant and Randy if you are reading this--get in touch with me!  

<p>PS  I will send ZOT pictures and some of my artwork soon.</p>

<p>God Bless,</p>

<p>Hey Chris. We used to go Lincoln Jr. High together, we were 2 of 3 drummers at the school. Remember your Moby Dick solo in the auditorium on your clear Ludwigs in 7th or 8th grade? Also your Deep Purple style band played at lunch a CDM HS? hey it's been 30 years now!</p>

<p>Haven't seen you since those days, I am up in Portland, Oregon now. Still playing drums and working at a jazz/blues radio station.</p>

<p>Just thought I'd say hi. Hope all is well!</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>

<p>It's me, Michele.  I remember the first time we met, it was after a motocross event, around 1884. You were with Ron and a couple of other people in the Stadium Motorsports van.  We had a few dates, renmained good friends, and i fell in love with your brother. Lost touch with Ron after moving out of the O.C.  and I think of all of you guys often. I have been keeping up with the Zot Website and was excited to see that you are doing great and still drumming and performing.  Would love to catch up.  Haven't spoke with Lisa in years, either.  Wer lost touch about 10 years ago. </p>

<p>Love and memories.</p>

<p>Michele</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>My daughter is a singer and performs.  She plays Huntington Beach next month.  i will be there, too!  What is Ron up to???</p>

<p>Chris,</p>

<p>It has been a long time since we've been in touch.  The last time I saw you I think was around 1983.  I live here in Orange County.  Send me an e-mail.  We should get together some time.</p>

<p>God Bless,</p>

<p>Chris,  Tyler Stringer from good ol' Ruby street on the Island.  I recently cleaned out some stuff from my parents house and came upon this album and remembered the days of hanging out in your garage behind Robert Ziegler's house and listening to you play drums waaaaaaaaaay before the formation of Zot.  Hope you are doing well. tyler@tylervision.com</p>

<p>I have some great photos taken by the photographer (Dale) who took the photo you have on the main page. I have great memories of Zot and the summer of 1985 and their great music that I will never forget. It propelled me on to work in music and radio where I am still currently employed.  Let me know if you want the pictures ! I have Deja Vu free tuesday passes too :) :) Lol.  And Pat's (who will forever rock in my heart) all access pass from the Night of Culture Club opening if anyone from his family would like it, let me know.  Oh and a few "behind the scenes" pix that I would only give to randy out of respect to him and his family...they might get a kick out of them :)thanks, Michelle </p>
