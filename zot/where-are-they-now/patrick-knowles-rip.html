<h2>Patrick Knowles R.I.P.</h2>

<p>I received some <i>very bad news</i> today.</p>

<div><a class="piclink" href="../../images/patrick_knowles.jpg"><img src="../../images/patrick-knowles.jpg" alt="Patrick Knowles" width="200" height="185" /></a></div>I don't have many details, but I received a couple of messages today saying that Patrick Knowles passed away on February 3, 2005, and that a memorial service will be held in California at a soon to be determined date.

<p>I have heard that Patrick was very sick, and suffering from an old injury to his back. I'm afraid that I don't have any more information than that at the moment.</p>

<p>It's hard to know what to say...I'm pretty shocked to hear this. Just back in October I was hearing about the <a href="../miscellanea/zot-reunion-in-the-works.html">possibilities of a Zot reunion</a>, and now this tragic news.</p>

<p>I know that Patrick will be sorely missed. Whenever I heard from anyone even remotely connected with the band they all asked about Patrick first. Although I never knew the man, I do know that his talent was considerable and that he certainly had a charisma that drew others to him. </p>

<p>Patrick, I'm just an old Zot fan living in Japan, but you and your music made a big impression on more people than you may ever know. The first mail message I ever got concerning the Zot page was from one of your co-workers who told me that you'd seen the page and you'd got a kick out of it. I'd always hoped that someday I'd have the opportunity to get in touch with you and ask you more about your music, but unfortunately that won't be possible now. You were too young to leave us Patrick. </p>

<p>Thank you for all the <a href="../audio-files/index.html">great music</a> and memories!</p>

<p>I am so shocked and saddened to hear this terrible news about Mr. Knowles. In the summer of 1985 when I was 15 years old I bought Zot's one and only LP and for the last 19 1/2 years it has been (and always will be) ranked up with my most favorite albums alongside of The Beatles and Journey. Even though the Zot LP didn't exactly enjoy widespread sales (one of the biggest injustices in music) Mr. Knowles' passing has hit my heart as deeply as John Lennon's. When I was 15 I was in the midst of a severe case of Crohn's Disease and life felt so bleak. But that summer when I first heard Patrick's power riff on Zot's "Uranium" it gave me such a jolt.</p>

<p>Thankfully a couple of years ago one of Patrick's friends contacted me through email when he found my webpage that mentions Zot. He was going to make Patrick a CDR of Patrick's old cassette copy of the album before it wore out. I volunteered to make Patrick a CDR of it from my pristine vinyl copy of it and sent it to him with a handwritten message to Patrick telling him how much I appreciate his efforts on that album. Even though I'll now never meet him at least I got to do that.</p>

<p>Thank you, Patrick, for the music. I will always cherish it.</p>

<p>A shocked and saddened Zot fan,<br />

<p>Patrick was my buddy. I was shocked to hear of the news that Patrick is gone. God, I know in his younger years Patrick knew all these guys but in recent years Patrick and I were not only co-workers but great friends. I remember going to his apartment and listening to a ZOT tape that he had. We started playing guitar together and writing some new songs together. As you had mentioned Patrick was in a pretty back accident but he seemed to recover pretty well from it. In fact I think he saw it as a blessing in disguise because all he wanted to do was to get some money from his lawsuit and buy some new recording equipment and get back to what he loved doing the most. I remember one time watching Patrick play guitar just at a little jam session we put together at a friends house and I was just amazed. I can't explain it. His chops were realy good but not phenominal but he just had perfect vibrato, rhythm, and style.. He was fun to watch play. Actually the picture you have of Patrick on your web site I sent to you quite a while back. I remember finding a guy who had taken an original ZOT albumn and converted it to CD. He sent me one and I made Patrick a copy. I wrapped it up and gave it to him and when he listened to it he was so excited. Patrick was such a wonderful guy...I really wish I could have done something to help him. I was looking through an old planner I have from work and opened it up and saw Patricks business card. If you'd like me to scan it for your website that would be cool. I've got many pictures of Patrick too. Well I don't know what else to say. Actually I thought I was going to be the one breaking the news to you about him and when I came to your website I saw that you already knew. That shocked me. Anyways If you'd like to know more about Patrick I'll let you know. Thanks so much for devoting a portion of your web space for him. I stll can't tell you how thrilled Patrick and I were to be able to go to yahoo.com type both our names in and have your web site pop up. He was so fascinated by it.<br />
Patrick I'll miss you deeply.<br />

<p>I spent many days with Pat.  After I joined the band in 1982, it was always my opinion that even though he was not the leader of the band, he was the most musically talented.  I thank this website for putting us back in touch before his untimely passing.  The world has lost a beautiful soul.  God bless you Patrick.  Much love.</p>

<p>I was shocked to hear of Pat's passing.  Pat & I were great friends in High School.  I will never forget those times.  After High School, we sort of drifted apart, but he was always a friend in my heart.  I was the band's "official" photographer in their early days, and was lucky to see the evolution of a talented musician. Pat, even though we haven't seen each other in many years, you will be dearly missed!<br />

<p>I was very disturbed by Pat's untimely departure.  I haven't seen him in quite a few years.  We both went to Marina high school and lived around the corner from each other.  I was known as the jock and he was the musician.  We were both born in Dec. of 1963.  I was a couple of weeks older.  He was a great guy and fun to talk too.  I got a couple of phone calls after his obituary was posted in newspaper.  I never really got to hear his music, but I would love to know how to obtain a copy of the uranium cd.  I heard a little of it on this site.  I know Pat will be missed by many people, including myself.<br />

<p>As I sit a little bored at work.  I was a friend during Jr. high (Ridge Circle) and some of Marina HS until I was sent to Wintersburg (bad kid).  I remember Pat as the guy who was expected to be a famous rock star.  He was the best guitarist in our area.  Think about this, we had Dave Mustane in "our area".  I joined the Navy in March of 1981 and have since retired and moved to a new career.  I have however kept in touch with a mutual freind of Pat's named Jean Jensen.  Hope this entry is seen by someone who remembers the neighborhood and all of us kids in it.  Also I was a proud owner of the Zot cassett!  My belated prayers go out to Pats family and friends.  God Bless!</p>

<p>Hi. I'm one of the seniors who bought an organ from the place where Patrick was working in Tucson,Arizona.</p>

<p>What a guy! More talent than one can imagine. The friendliest person I've ever met. Even though it was very evident that he was suffering from great pain in his back most of the time, he still was able to be smiling, laughing,and always entertaining. </p>

<p>He loved to show his skill at the organ not just to sell one, but to make music that would put everyone in a lively, happy mood.</p>

<p>It was a terrible shock to all of us seniors to learn of Patrick's passing. I am one who generally has a camera in my purse so I have several snaphots of Patrick that I shall cherish always.</p>

<p>The management at the organ store made a giant poster with pictures of Patrick on it and then many of us got to write a message on it. It was given to Patrick's father. I hope he finds some comfort in knowing his son was such a joy to be around and that we here in Tucson will never forget him.   </p>

<p>Patrick was my dearest friend for the last 13 years of his life. I am so touched by all the above. He told me of perrin3 when he discovered it 2-3 years ago. It really made him happy. The "zot era" was a very important,and happy time of his life.<br />
     He also went on tour with Maria Conchita Alanzo during that time.If anyone has pictures or music from that Central & S. American tour,I'd be interested.<br />
      Privately,Patrick was a fun & kitty loving "family member" my daughter&I will sorely miss this first Thanksgiving&Christmas we'll spend without him since we met.Prayforhisfamily'scomfort.He loved Jesus.-Louise</p>

<p>This was one of my favorite bands that i discovered when i was in high school. My musical taste ran the board from hair bands to pop to metal. This is and will always be a prize tape in my collection. This coming from a 6'2" 250lb man from Alabama. I am sad to hear of Patrick's passing. The band had such a great sound and i know i turned a lot of friends on to them. Thank you to this site for giving us a forum to remember a great band.</p>

<p>I just stumbled onto this page tonight - one of those things you go looking for from time to time.  I will spend the rest of my evening thinking of Patrick and the sparkle and shine that he brought with those sparkling blue eyes that went on forever and always promised some kind of mischief.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Pat's family and friends. If I had known, I would have paid my respects in person.  Such a wonderful person, so full of life and tricks - LOL!     </p>

<p>Sorry about the double entry with nothing but hello....Well for those of you who might and might not know.  I was married to Patrick at the time of his passing and although were not living together as a couple, I still feel fortunate to have not just known him but have been such a special part of his life.  We were married on June 25th, 1993 in Tucson.  What a lot of people don't know is what a great song writer Patrick was I was fortunate to have been with him durings a time of his life where he was discovering his song writing abilities and let me tell you, he was amazing as a songwriter as he was a guitar player, and what a beautiful voice with perfect pitch.  This man was a genius and of course I thought he was cause he was Patrick but the many different talented and accomplished musicans that showed up at his service was testament to how much he was admired, respected and loved.</p>

<p>About a month after his passing, I got an email from Dave Diamond of Berlin who went on and on about how much he loved Patrick how he felt he was a talent to be reckoned and how sad he was that he did not find out till later.  I thought I had saved the email but found out that I infact had deleted it, I wish I hadn't as it would have been something to post on this site. </p>

<p>May meeting with Patrick began when he was just 13 and I was 15 years old.  The strangest thing about it was, years after we had met (we first met in an party in an alley in Huntington Beach) and we kept runnning into each other, Van Halen 1977 at Anaheim Stadium and countless other backyard parties too I am sure.  But then again in 1984 when they were celebrating getting signed to Elektra me and my girlfreind Tracey met his band, the management and entourage in the parking lot of the Old Baxters in Huntington Beach.   </p>

<p>There is really a whole story to be told and maybe I should write a book, it would make great reading, let me put it this way....I have known many a talented musician in my day but something about Patrick.  He wrote me the most beautiful song ever called Meri Gayle and when his father had to collect his stuff from his apartment he had found written on a cardboard box the lyrics to "Meri Gayle"....I take a photo of it, along with other memorbelia and photos I have of Patrick.  He was amazing, and I was blessed to have shared his life.</p>

<p>God Bless To everyone...<br />
Zot Rocks and will always as far as i'm concerned<br />
20  years later and the CD goes strong...</p>

<p>I was lucky to have lunch with Pat just months before he passed  ..seems like last week ..we had a great time, lots of laughs ..was a blast. I remember thinking he should be a movie star ..he looked great. Anyway, he's probably jamming with some other hot players right now up in the sky.</p>

<p>My buddy James and I used to see Zot! in Costa Mesa, and the rare times they played at Marina High School always enjoyed their rendition of Ziggy Stardust.   My friend Jim dated Liz Patrick's sister.  I was saddened to see his name on the 1982 Marina Reunion's memorial list (I was 1983 class).  Liz if you read this, my condolences on the loss of your brother.  Shoot me an email would love to catch up.</p>

<p>I'm way behind on this news and stumbled across the Zot website recently via a friend going down memory lane and bringing up the band.  Patrick was truly a great guitar player and a friend in the summer of 1985. Even though some craziness happened the night before and the night of the band opening for Culture Club and my purse disappeared from the limo that night, I have such great memories of Pat and his charisma and hilarious but sexy facial expressions while he was playing a mean guitar.  I have his all access pass in my scrapbook from the concert that night and some photos that are near and dear to my heart that I will send copies to the administrator of the Zot website.  He and the band are cherished memories for me.  I loved being a part of this good music so much right as I was turning 18, that I went on to be a lead singer of a band myself for awhile; then made a career for myself in radio where I still am working today.  Thank you Pat and thank you Zot for such great times and making great music !! Michelle </p>
