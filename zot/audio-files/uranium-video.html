<h2>The Uranium Video</h2>

<p>The 20+ year wait is over. I have for you here Zot's video for the song <strong>Uranium</strong>. </p>

<p>Recorded on November 12, 1984, the Uranium video made it into heavy rotation <a href="../photos/mtv-interview-premiere-of-uranium-video.html">on MTV</a> during the summer of 1985 for a short time. </p>

<p><img src="../../images/zot/uranium-thumb-1.jpg" alt="Uranium video" /></p>

<div id="a000028more"><div id="more">
<p>When the video first came out I remember thinking that I was a bit ahead of the curve because I already had <a href="the-album-zot.html">the Zot album</a>. However, for the last two decades I'd been kicking myself for not taping a copy of this video. At the time I thought this song and this band would have a lot more staying power.</p>

<p>Thanks for this video go out to the family of the late <strong>Patrick Knowles</strong> who provided me with a copy. The video tape is 20 years old, but it has held up pretty well. The sound has a bit of static I couldn't remove, but it adds a bit of character. I've spent the last few months tweaking this video and encoding it over and over again to get it into shape.</p>

<p>Hello Bill,</p>

<p>I got excited when I saw you entered the Zot video on your website.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong though.  Clicked on everything I could.  Got a message that it was downloading, but haven't been able to bring it up yet.  Any ideas?  Thanks.</p>

<p>Above you'll see a link in this line:<br />
<ul><li><b><a href="../../images/zot/zot-uranium.wmv" rel="nofollow">Zot - "Uranium" video</a></b> Windows Media .wmv 6.3MB</li></ul><br />
That's the video link. Place your mouse cursor over the link and click once with the <i>right button</i> on your mouse. You should see a little menu on the screen. Select <i><b>Save Target As...</b></i> You should then get a dialog box that will ask you where you want to save the file. The easiest place for you to find it would probably be the <i>desktop</i>. However, you can save it anywhere.</p>

<p>I love you!  I saw this video once, bought the tape, loved the band, and wished I could see it again.  I even wrote in to VH1 Classic Requests to see if they could find it! (Haven't heard anything yet; sent it right before I found your website.  </p>

<p>I can't believe this!  We (my girlfriends and I)  spent so much time with the guys and this all just comes flooding back.  Chris told us about Pat's passing and I was very saddened by the news.  Another friend of all of ours - Colin had died some years back and I heard something had also happened to Manny (If anyone has news)another firend of all of ours.    </p>

<p>My thoughts and prayers are with Pat's family and friends - had I known sooner - I would have been there to pay my respects.  </p>

<p>Thank you for your time and effort to putting this site together - I can only speak for myself but it means so much to me - what a wonderful gift.  I haven't heard the album in so long - I gave to it someone and could have kicked myself about a dozen times since then.    WOW - what else can I say?!  I sent Bryant a e-mail - so we'll see - he was the sweetest person I had ever met - such a dolly - really. </p>

<p>I saw Chris a while ago - looks the same! :)</p>

<p>I am just so blown by this!  Hello to everyone!  Thank you again for the time and effort on the site - it made me smile!!   </p>

<p>Borrowed the ZOT album from a friend in the eighties and loved it.  Bought the album from a record warehouse online in 1994 (over my 'compuserve' account and a blazing 14.4K modem).  Ripped vinyl to MP3 in 1996, but I never connected my tunes library to a P2P program like Napster.  Thanks so much for the video, and this website.  ZOT is in my top 10 reasons to invent the TIME MACHINE.  We love you Zot!</p>

<p>Many, many years ago (must have been around 1990), I bought a stack of records on a flea market for quite nothing. Between a lot of crap and some standards, I found the Zot album and really loved it from the start. Playing it to some friends, it claimed a lot of attention (but noone ever heard of it before).<br />
Have been looking occasionally, if this is avaiable on CD, but never found it. A while back, I went through YouTube, looking for some 80ies stuff, just for the memories, and I was amazed finding the Uranium video there. And my amazement got even bigger, when I saw the link to this site and the downloads!<br />
Still love this music and everytime, I make people aware of it, it gets some new fans.<br />
It would be a dream, if this record would be re-mastered on CD with a high quality Uranium video as a bonus :-)</p>

<p>wowwwww...flooded with emotions.  I'm very saddened by the news about Pat Knowles, he truly was one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. My thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.<br />
 I have so many stories and wonderful memories of meeting ZOT for the first time and all the gigs and rehearsals and parties....Best times ever. I just came across an old photo or 2 of me on stage with Randy and Chris/Zot shaking a tamborine at De ja vu in Newport/Costa Mesa hahaha so silly, but omg fun! I'm so happy for this site, thank you so much.<br />

<p>Does anyone have any info on Craig Olivas?  He played guitar, myself drums - in a garage band in the late 70's Huntington Beach.  We played many of the huge downtown parties of that era.  I have never heard from him since and have always wondered what became of him.  He was an amazing guitar player - problem was that tallent seemed to play a small part in whether one became a "star".  Ironically, I did become wealthy from the rock and roll industry - but from the production side.  Bob Bostob</p>

<p>I was just thinking of the group the other day. I saw the video on MTV when I learned they were the basement tape winners. I saw the last little bit of the video one time. Later the full thing. I had a local record store to see if it was on 45 at the time but only had it in LP. The owner sold it to me for real nice price and brought it home to listen. BAM! I fell in love with the whole thing. Not played alot but love it still.. and when I found the video on YouTube I had to download it. I am gonna work on my own to burn it off for CD to listen again.. Thanks Randy and guys for making a great album.</p>

<p>Long story, but I was going through the last of my personal possessions from long ago. I came across an old song compolation list I made for a mixed tape for 1988. Near the top was Uranium... Brain clicked and I had an AH HA moment. Dusted off the memory bin and realized I had forgotten a great band from my early years. Thanks so much for posting the music on your site. I don't know where my tape went. Long story... I consider everyone of your songs a hit!Iplayed the @#%%$** out of your tape back intheday.Planon doing it again!</p>
