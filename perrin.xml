<title>Howto remove/disable Nero Scout in Nero 8</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In the time that I've used Nero 8 I've found it seems to run more smoothly than its predecessor. However, one leftover still remains that I think is completely unnecessary, Nero Scout. If you search the web you'll find many pages telling you how to remove Nero Scout from Nero 7. It's a major system hog that will suck away your resources. </p>]]></description>

<title>PGP</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>PGP is the original encryption tool for securing your communications and data. PGP stands for <a href="http://pgp.com/">Pretty Good Privacy</a>. Released by Phil Zimmerman in 1991, Network Associates acquired PGP Inc. at the end of 1997, but PGP Corporation eventually bought back PGP products and intellectual property from Network Associates in 2002.</p>]]></description>

<title>Translating Japanese Online</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Translating between Japanese and English can be a daunting task...luckily there 
are plenty of resources and tools online to 'ease the pain' a little. Most of these 
sites require you to be able to see Japanese on your system. </p>

<title>Using Japanese on an English PC</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It can be confusing trying to get Japanese to work on your PC, but luckily there 
are a lot of other people out there that had the same problem and put up some resources 
to help out. This is not a comprehensive guide, but rather links to sites I found 
that can help you use Japanese on your system.</p>

<title>ye olde 80s music page</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This page is dedicated to some of the bands that make life worth living. My taste 
in music has been criticized for years because for the most part I seem to be stuck 
in the 1980's. However, there are a few bands here that have survived into the 90's. 
Regardless of their musical ability, the bands on this page are some of my favorites 
from the New Wave, Gothic, and Industrial genres.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I got most of these in an e-mail back in 1995. They've been here on my site since 
1996 and have been "appropriated" by several other sites...one even copyrighted 
them! Oh well...</p>]]></description>
