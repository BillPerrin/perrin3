<p>You guys are missing the point. you need to find out what the schools are blocking on these sites. instead of making new servers, try making a server that doesnt have the one thing the school filters look for. try that approach it might work. i am trying myself on these filter capabilities, ill post again if i find anything</p>

<p>www.backfox.com<br />
www.btunnel.com<br />
www.ctunnel.com<br />
www.dtunnel.com</p>

<p>This proxy will fill your needs... myspace and all... i have the same problem as the rest of you and this one does not disappoint... it starts slow but speeds up.</p>

<p>It starts at google and the school can\\\'t detect what you are doing because they think that you are on google, no matter where you go from there... i like it too</p>

<p>hey, I've tried all of these websites, and like the chick earlier said, none of them will work anyway, b/c of the keywords found on the sites.  But a while back a friend of mine just found some codes, and they werent like URLs, they were like 10.944.56....you know, like that.  he said one of them was actually to some server in turkey or something.  any thoughts?  I mean, couldnt we just switch the school's proxy codes with our home computer's codes?  wouldnt that work?</p>

<p>Well www.unblockworld.com works for myspace but errors occur if you have a real strong firewall. Another one is www.firewalldown.com but you can't sign in secure sites like myspace and msn hotmail and stuff like that. Well look me up on myspace and hit me up.

<p>"Omg, I NEED myspace."  O_o what the heck! Why do you "NEED" myspace?  You can talk to your friends face to face or on the phone. Its not like any of them will really be on during school anyway.  And if you're in a relation ship with a friend that you can't talk to or call, then you're stupid.  <br />
Find something better to do with your time.<br />
Proxies can be used for more than myspace.</p>

<p>You Guys do know There are too reasons why most of these Websites don't work. 1.) People Probably do Searches on google just as you did to find websites && they report them then block them from schools. 2) Everytime A wise Ass uses Myspace or finds a way at there school, if you don't DELETE THE HISTORY AFTER YOU GET ON IT, when someone checks the History they go through ALL OF THE LINKS, If they find a bad website, they report && Block it. 3) If you tell too many people how to get on, A teacher or someone who is a Tad bit retarded will spill, && tell. I say Myspace should be used at school, but no matter how hard to fight to get it, it's not going to happen.</p>

<p>Hokay,<br />
I need a really untrackable proxy. I happen to be within the proxy block system implemented at every UBI campus around Northern Ireland and need something to give them back for pissing us all off. Any methods to infect the 'server' of the campus so it will release all sites it had ever blocked? If you know do get in contact with me at my e-mail address....i'm gonna teach these people how to play ball.<br />

Plan 1:creating a website compleatly for school info BUT, on the webserch you can accese anything if you have the proxy program<br />
Plan 2: would be by poupesly puting the proxy on YOUR school computer/s and go where ever the hell you want to go.<br />
Dont ask me what,where,when, or how because this would take some time.</p>

<p>Hey! Check this shit out yall. Everytime yall post a proxy, or thing to get around myspace, a school technician sees that shit and blocks it. So if yall are going to tell people proxies, then you need to e-mail it to them or something so you don't just give yourself out to people. If you find proxies that work, please e-mail them to me. sexeho@yahoo.com. Thanks! And e-mail me for new sites and I will give you some. Good luck and much love!</p>

my school is kind of not all that smart and havent figured out how to block proxies.<br />
but the main one i use to is <br />
xyso.com <br />
the sucky thing is im looking for a proxy that allows you to post bulletins, reply to messages and post comments.<br />
help meee?<br />
but its not all that big of a deal<br />
btw.<br />
kiddssss stop being myspace nerds, your at school, dont you have any friends there you can talk to ?<br />
