<h2>You know you've been in Japan too long when...</h2>

<p>I got most of these in an e-mail back in 1995. They've been here on my site since 
1996 and have been "appropriated" by several other sites...one even copyrighted 
them! Oh well...</p>

to see if anybody's home.</li>
	<li>...your top is thinning and you consider it "barcode style".</li>
	<li>...when you find nothing unusual in a television commercial for candy in which

skips away.</li>

Yume de aimashou) and kept her mouth shut.</li>
	<li>...you have discovered the sexual attraction of high school navy uniforms.</li>

his mail for a while.</li>
	<li>...you think the meaning of a red traffic light is: "Hurry up! 10 cars now in quick 
succession, and then we'll think about slowing down."</li>
	<li>...when you get on a train with a number of gaijin on it and you feel uneasy because 
the harmony is broken.</li>
	<li>...you ask fellow foreigners the all-important question "How long have you been

	<li>...the Yakult lady knows you by name.</li>

	<li>...when in the middle of nowhere, totally surrounded by rice fields and abundant

of a power supply...</li>
	<li>...and when you think nothing of it when that lonely vending machine says 'thank 
you' after you buy a coke.</li>
	<li>...you stand before a sign on a bridge and ponder the possible meanings of "Bridge 
Freezes Before Road."</li>
	<li>...it takes fifteen seconds of deep thought to recall the first name of the President 
of the United States.</li>
	<li>...you have a favorite bush to pee behind.</li>
	<li>...the TV commercials make sense to you.</li>
	<li>...a non-Japanese sits down next to you on the train and you get up and move. You're 
not prejudiced, but who knows what they might do?</li>
	<li>...you are outwardly appalled to see someone pour miso shiru over rice, but do 
it in private yourself (neko meshi).</li>
	<li>...when having gaijin around you is a source of stress.</li>
	<li>...you only have 73 transparent, plastic umbrellas in your entrance because you 
have donated 27 to the JR and various taxi companies in the past few months.</li>
	<li>...you have over 100 small, transparent plastic umbrellas in your entrance even 
*after* donating 27 of them to taxis and JR recently.</li>
	<li>...you realize it's perfectly reasonable for the Post Office to designate you as 
the local redistribution agent for all letters addressed in yokomoji.</li>
	<li>...when you absolutely do not possess the ability to mispronounce Japanese words 
"like a non-Japanese would."</li>
	<li>...when you pay over 6000 yen for a lipstick and realize a few days later how much 
you really spent. (Or yen 7000 for a Captain Santa T-shirt)</li>
	<li>...when you're arguing with someone about the color of the traffic light being 
blue or green...and you think it's blue.</li>
	<li>...you think that, in a crowd of Japanese, the presence of another foreigner breaks 
the "wa," although for some reason your presence doesn't.</li>

Blue for 160 yen a can.</li>
	<li>...you can't have your picture taken without your fingers forming the peace sign.</li>

but you discover the knack of peeling the mikan so that the peel forms a neat receptacle 
for you to spit the membranes into.</li>

in English.</li>

a tear rolling out of my eye."</li>
	<li>...you start to recognize BGM as a meaningful genre of music.</li>

	<li>...you walk to the local seven eleven in your wife's shoes.</li>

traffic when you take a leak outside (sorry ladies!).</li>
	<li>...you enjoy drinking until you vomit (hey we have those over here !).</li>
	<li>...you start shunning foreigners you meet far away from your metropolitan abode 
in Tokyo (they're probably not worth talking to).</li>
	<li>...you remember when shouchu was not a chic drink drunk by high school girls, but

telephone.</li>

who stopped by to 'borrow' your phone.</li>
